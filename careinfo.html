                <h2>Watering:</h2>
                <p>Bonsai trees require consistent watering, but the frequency depends on the tree species, pot size, soil type, and environment. Generally, water when the soil feels slightly dry to the touch. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely or stay waterlogged.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="care-box">
                <h2>Sunlight:</h2>
                <p>Most bonsai trees prefer bright, indirect sunlight for several hours a day. Place your bonsai in a spot where it gets plenty of natural light, but be cautious of direct, harsh sunlight, especially during peak hours, as it can cause leaf burn.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="care-box">
                <h2>Fertilizing:</h2>
                <p>Bonsai trees need to be fertilized regularly, especially during their growing season (spring to autumn). Use a balanced fertilizer with equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to support healthy growth. However, be cautious not to over-fertilize, as this can damage the roots and affect the tree’s overall health.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="care-box">
                <h2>Pest & Disease Control:</h2>
                <p>Regularly inspect your bonsai for signs of pests or diseases, such as discolored leaves, spots, or unusual growths. Treat any issues promptly using appropriate insecticides or fungicides to prevent the spread of diseases.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="care-box">
                <h2>Potting:</h2>
                <p>Bonsai trees need to be repotted every 2-3 years to ensure healthy growth. When repotting, prune the roots slightly to encourage new growth and to keep the tree’s size in balance with its pot. Use a well-draining bonsai soil mix to avoid water retention, which can lead to root rot.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="care-box">
                <h2>Trimming:</h2>
                <p>Regular trimming and pruning are crucial to maintain the desired shape and size of your bonsai. Remove any dead or overly large branches, and pinch back new growth to keep the tree’s shape compact. This also encourages the development of finer branches, which enhance the tree’s aesthetic.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="care-box">
                <h2>Humidity & Temperature:</h2>
                <p>Bonsai trees thrive in environments with moderate humidity. If you live in a dry climate, consider using a humidity tray or misting the tree regularly. Additionally, be mindful of temperature fluctuations, especially if you keep your bonsai indoors, as sudden changes can stress the tree.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="care-box">
                <h2>Wiring:</h2>
                <p>Wiring is used to shape the branches of the bonsai. It should be done carefully to avoid damaging the bark. Wires can stay on the tree for a few months, but they should be removed before they start digging into the bark as the branches grow.</p>
